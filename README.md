<h1>Combinatorial Auction Test Suite (CATS)</h1>
<b><i>Version 2.2</i></b>

The Combinatorial Auction Test Suite is a generator of combinatorial auction instances for the testing of CA algorithms. It features five distributions of instances from realistic, economically motivated domains, as well as a collection of artificial distributions that have been used in the literature. Since the release of CATS 1.0 in 2000, it has become a standard benchmark for the evaluation and comparison of CA algorithms.
